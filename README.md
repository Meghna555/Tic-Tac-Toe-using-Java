# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Java
This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. It allows two players to play the game in the command line by taking turns entering the row and column where they want to place their mark. The game ends when one of the players wins or when the grid is full and no more moves can be made.
